**Data Mining Projects for Graduate Computer Science**

This repository contains various data mining projects completed as part of a graduate computer science course. The projects explore different techniques and applications of data mining, using various tools and programming languages. Each project includes a detailed description, code implementation, and results analysis.

**Project Overview**

* **Project 1: Customer Segmentation**
    * **Description:** Analyze customer data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.
    * **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
    * **Results:** Identified four customer segments with distinct characteristics and purchasing patterns.

* **Project 2: Sentiment Analysis**
    * **Description:** Classify movie reviews as positive or negative using sentiment analysis techniques.
    * **Tools:** Python, NLTK, VaderSentiment
    * **Results:** Achieved an accuracy of 85% in sentiment classification using a Naive Bayes classifier.

* **Project 3: Market Basket Analysis**
    * **Description:** Discover frequent itemset patterns in transaction data to identify potential product groupings for upselling and cross-selling.
    * **Tools:** Python, Apriori algorithm
    * **Results:** Identified frequent itemsets with high support and confidence, suggesting potential product groupings.

**Project Contributions**

I have contributed to these projects by:

* **Data preprocessing:** Cleaning, organizing, and transforming data for analysis.
* **Exploratory data analysis:** Visualizing and summarizing data to understand its characteristics and patterns.
* **Model development:** Implementing various data mining algorithms and evaluating their performance.
* **Results analysis:** Interpreting and communicating findings from data analysis.

**Future Directions**

Further exploration of data mining techniques and applications is planned, including:

* **Predictive modeling:** Developing models to predict customer behavior or future outcomes.
* **Recommendation systems:** Building systems to recommend products or services to users based on their preferences.
* **Big data mining:** Exploring techniques for handling and analyzing large-scale datasets.
